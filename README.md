# Implementation-of-CHOKe-in-ns3

### Overview:

CHOKe(CHOose and Keep for responsive flows,CHOose and Kill for unresponsive flows) is an active queue management algorithm that punishes flows which send more packets than their fair share to a router [1]. Linux Kernal code for CHOKe is available [2]. This repository contains an implementation of CHOKe in ns-3 [3].
